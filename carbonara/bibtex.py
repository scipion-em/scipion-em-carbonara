  abstract  = "Protein design and engineering are evolving at an unprecedented
               pace leveraging the advances in deep learning. Current models
               nonetheless cannot natively consider non-protein entities within
               the design process. Here, we introduce a deep learning approach
               based solely on a geometric transformer of atomic coordinates
               and element names that predicts protein sequences from backbone
               scaffolds aware of the restraints imposed by diverse molecular
               environments. To validate the method, we show that it can
               produce highly thermostable, catalytically active enzymes with
               high success rates. This concept is anticipated to improve the
               versatility of protein design pipelines for crafting desired
               functions.",
